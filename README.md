## To Dos

- [ ] Chat

  - [ ] Chat API vs Completions API
  - [ ] Interface
  - [ ] Gather content from website for every company
  - [ ] Enrich company data by scraping cvr-virk
  - [ ] Upgrade to Vercel Pro (This is needed to increase the timeout of serverless functions. Once we get our MF network sorted we can run everything locally, which will also speed up the response time.)

- [ ] Planets

  - [ ] Update planet structure to reflect the corporate structure (as seen below)
  - [ ] Replace HTML content with native three text and geometries (This is to address issues on safari)
  - [ ] Change images out with logos

- [ ] Sun

  - [ ] Replace floating projector screen with video playing warped and playing over planet
  - [ ] Add playback controls (play/pause/restart)
  - [ ] Content

    - [ ] Descriptive text
